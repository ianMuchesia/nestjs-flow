- **Why do we need refresh tokens?**

  So far, we’ve implemented JWT access tokens. They have a specific expiration time that should be short. If someone steals it from our user, the token is usable just until it expires.

  After the user logs in successfully, we send back the access token. Let’s say that it has an expiry of 15 minutes. During this period, it can be used by the user to authenticate while making various requests to our API.

  After the expiry time passes, the user needs to log in by again providing the username and password. This does not create the best user experience, unfortunately. On the other hand, increasing the expiry time of our access token might make our API less secure.

  The solution to the above issue might be refresh tokens. The basic idea is that on a successful log-in, we create two separate JWT tokens. One is an access token that is valid for 15 minutes. The other one is a refresh token that has an expiry of a week, for example.


- **How refresh tokens work**
  The user saves both of the tokens in cookies but uses just the access token to authenticate while making requests. It works for 15 minutes without issues. Once the API states that the access token expires, the user needs to perform a refresh.

  The crucial thing about storing tokens in cookies is that they should use the httpOnly flag. For more information, check out Cookies: [explaining document.cookie and the Set-Cookie header](https://wanago.io/2018/06/18/cookies-explaining-document-cookie-and-the-set-cookie-header/)

  To refresh the token, the user needs to call a separate endpoint, called  /refresh. This time, the refresh token is taken from the cookies and sent to the API. If it is valid and not expired, the user receives the new access token. Thanks to that, there is no need to provide the username and password again.


- **Addressing some of the potential issues**

  Unfortunately, we need to consider the situation in which the refresh token is stolen. It is quite a sensitive piece of data, almost as much as the password.

  We need to deal with the above issue in some way. The most straightforward way of doing so is changing the JWT secret once we know about the data leak. Doing that would render all of our refresh tokens invalid, and therefore, unusable.

  We might not want to log out every user from our application, though. Assuming we know the affected user, we would like to make just one refresh token invalid. JWT is in its core stateless, though.

  One of the solutions that we might stumble upon while browsing the web is a blacklist. Every time someone uses a refresh token, we check if it is in the blacklist first. Unfortunately, this does not seem like a solution that would have good enough performance. Checking the blacklist upon every token refresh and keeping it up-to-date might be a demanding task.

  An alternative is saving the current refresh token in the database upon logging in. When someone performs a refresh, we check if the token kept in the database matches the provided one. If it is not the case, we reject the request. Thanks to doing the above, we can easily make the token of a particular person invalid by removing it from the database.

- **Logging out**

  So far, when the user logged out, we’ve just removed the JWT token from cookies. While this might be a viable solution for tokens with a short expiry time, it creates some issues with refresh tokens. Even though we removed the refresh token from the browser, it is still valid for a long time.

  We can address the above issue by removing the refresh token from the database once the user logs out. If someone tries to use the refresh token before it expires, it is not possible anymore.

- **Preventing logging in on multiple devices**

  Let’s assume that we provide services that require a monthly payment. Allowing many people to use the same account at the same time might have a negative impact on our business.

  Saving the refresh token upon logging in can help us deal with the above issue too. If someone uses the same user credentials successfully, it overwrites the refresh token stored in the database. Thanks to doing that, the previous person is not able to use the old refresh token anymore.


- **A potential database leak**

  We’ve mentioned that the refresh token is sensitive data. If it leaks out, the attacker can easily impersonate our user.

  We have a similar case with the passwords. This is why we keep hashes of the passwords instead of just plain text. We can improve our refresh token solution similarly.

  If we hash our refresh tokens before saving them in the database, we prevent the attacker from using them even if our database is leaked.

Now we start to implement **JWT refresh token in Nestjs**

### Implementation in Nestjs

- Add new variables environment:
  ```env
  # .env
  JWT_REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET=somesecretforjwtrefreshtoken
  # 30d
  JWT_REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRATION_TIME= 2592000
  ```

  And update in `node.d.ts`
  ```ts
  declare namespace NodeJS {
    interface ProcessEnv {
      // ...
      readonly JWT_REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET: string;
      readonly JWT_REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRATION_TIME: string;
    }
  }
  ```
- Create new column for **UserEntity** to stock a **refresh token code** encrypted
  ```diff
  + @Column({
  +    nullable: true,
  +  })
  +  @Exclude()
  +  public currentHashedRefreshToken?: string;
  ```
- We also need to create a function for creating a method for creating a cookie with the refresh token and method to save the hash of the current refresh token. We will update in `auth.service.ts`

  ```ts
  // auth.service.ts
  // Method to get access token cookie
   public getCookieWithToken(payload: IPayloadJwt) {
    const token = this.jwtService.sign(payload, {
      secret: process.env.JWT_SECRET,
      expiresIn: `${process.env.JWT_EXPIRATION_TIME}s`,
    });
    return `Authorization=${token};HttpOnly;Path=/;Max-Age=${process.env.JWT_EXPIRATION_TIME}`;
  }

  // Method to get refresh token cookie
  public getCookieWithJwtRefreshToken(payload: IPayloadJwt) {
    const token = this.jwtService.sign(payload, {
      secret: process.env.JWT_REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET,
      expiresIn: `${process.env.JWT_REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRATION_TIME}s`,
    });
    const cookie = `Refresh=${token}; HttpOnly; Path=/; Max-Age=${process.env.JWT_REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRATION_TIME}`;
    return {
      cookie,
      token,
    };
  }



  ```

  We need create some methods helpers for `AuthService` to create in `auth.repository.ts`:
  ```ts
  // auth.repository.ts
    public async updateRefreshToken(
    user: User,
    currentHashedRefreshToken: string,
  ) {
    await this.save({
      ...user,
      currentHashedRefreshToken: currentHashedRefreshToken,
    });
    return user;
  }


  ```
- Let’s make sure that we send both cookies when logging in.
  Update `auth.controller`:
  ```ts
  @Post('login')
  @UseGuards(LocalAuthGuard)
  public async login(@Req() req: IRequestWithUser) {
    const { user } = req;
    const payload: IPayloadJwt = {
      userId: user.id,
      email: user.email,
    };
    const accessTokenCookie = this.authService.getCookieWithToken(payload);
    const {
      cookie: refreshTokenCookie,
      token: refreshToken,
    } = this.authService.getCookieWithJwtRefreshToken(payload);
    await this.authService.setCurrentRefreshToken(user, refreshToken);
    this.authService.setHeaderArray(req.res, [
      accessTokenCookie,
      refreshTokenCookie,
    ]);
    return user;
  }
  ```
### Creating an endpoint that uses the refresh token

Now we can start handling the incoming refresh token. For starters, let’s deal with checking if the token from cookies matches the one in the database.

- Create method retrieve **user** from **refresh token** in `auth.service.ts`

  ```ts
  // auth.service.ts
   public async setCurrentRefreshToken(
    user: User,
    refreshToken: string,
  ): Promise<User> {
    const salt = await bcrypt.genSalt(10);
    const currentHashedRefreshToken = await bcrypt.hash(refreshToken, salt);

    return await this.authRepository.updateRefreshToken(
      user,
      currentHashedRefreshToken,
    );
  }
  ```

  And method helper from `auth.repository.ts`
  ```ts
  // auth.repository.ts
    // Get user with from refresh token
  public async getUserIfRefreshTokenMatches(
    refreshToken: string,
    userId: string,
  ) {
    const user = await this.getUserById(userId);

    const isRefreshTokenMatching = await bcrypt.compare(
      refreshToken,
      user.currentHashedRefreshToken,
    );
    if (isRefreshTokenMatching) return user;
    return null;
  }
  public setHeaderSingle(res: Response, cookie: string): void {
    res.setHeader('Set-Cookie', cookie);
  }
  public setHeaderArray(res: Response, cookies: string[]): void {
    res.setHeader('Set-Cookie', cookies);
  }
  ```
- Create new strategy `jwt-refresh-token` from PassportStrategy
  Create new file `src/modules/auth/strategies/jwt-refresh-token.strategy.ts`
  ```ts
  // jwt-refresh-token.strategy.ts
  import { IPayloadJwt } from '../auth.interface';
  import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';
  import { ExtractJwt, Strategy } from 'passport-jwt';
  import { PassportStrategy } from '@nestjs/passport';
  import { Request } from 'express';
  import { InjectRepository } from '@nestjs/typeorm';
  import { AuthRepository } from '../auth.repository';

  @Injectable()
  export class JwtRefreshTokenStrategy extends PassportStrategy(
    Strategy,
    'jwt-refresh-token',
  ) {
    constructor(
      @InjectRepository(AuthRepository)
      private readonly authRepository: AuthRepository,
    ) {
      super({
        jwtFromRequest: ExtractJwt.fromExtractors([
          (req: Request) => {
            return req?.cookies?.Refresh;
          },
        ]),
        ignoreExpiration: false,
        secretOrKey: process.env.JWT_REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET,
        passReqToCallback: true,
      });
    }
    public async validate(req: Request, payload: IPayloadJwt) {
      const refreshToken = req.cookies?.Refresh;
      return this.authRepository.getUserIfRefreshTokenMatches(
        refreshToken,
        payload.userId,
      );
    }
  }

  ```
  **Note**: We use the name `jwt-refresh-token` for the name of guard. And Please note that we use the  passReqToCallback parameter so that we can access the cookies in our  validate method.

- Create new guard : `src/modules/auth/guards/jwt-refresh-token.guard.ts`
  ```ts
  // jwt-refresh-token.guard.ts
  import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';
  import { AuthGuard } from '@nestjs/passport';

  @Injectable()
  export class JwtRefreshTokenAuthGuard extends AuthGuard('jwt-refresh-token') {}

  ```

- Update **JwtRefreshTokenStrategy** in **AuthModule**
  ```ts
  // auth.module.ts
  // ...
  @Module({
    imports: [
      ConfigModule.forRoot(),
      TypeOrmModule.forFeature([AuthRepository]),
      PassportModule,
      JwtModule.register({}),
    ],
    providers: [AuthService, LocalStrategy, JwtStrategy, JwtRefreshTokenStrategy],
    exports: [AuthService],
    controllers: [AuthController],
  })
  export class AuthModule {}

  ```
- Now, the last thing to do is to create the  `/refresh` endpoint in `AuthController`
  ```ts
  // auth.controller.ts
  // ...
  @UseGuards(JwtRefreshTokenAuthGuard)
  @Get('refresh')
  public refresh(@Req() req: IRequestWithUser) {
    const { user } = req;
    const payload: IPayloadJwt = {
      userId: user.id,
      email: user.email,
    };
    const accessTokenCookie = this.authService.getCookieWithToken(payload);
    this.authService.setHeaderSingle(req.res, accessTokenCookie);
    return req.user;
  }
  ```
  **Note**: Please make sure we use `@UseGuards(JwtRefreshTokenAuthGuard)`

  We will make request this endpoint in front-end side.

### Improving the log-out flow

- Update methods in `src/modules/auth/auth.service.ts`
  ```ts
  // auth.service.ts
  public async removeRefreshToken(user: User): Promise<User> {
    return await this.authRepository.clearRefreshToken(user);
  }

  public clearCookie(res: Response): void {
    const emptyCookie = [
      'Authentication=; HttpOnly; Path=/; Max-Age=0',
      'Refresh=; HttpOnly; Path=/; Max-Age=0',
    ];
    res.setHeader('Set-Cookie', emptyCookie);
  }

  ```
- Use theses methods in our **AuthController**
  ```ts
  // auth.controller.ts
  @Post('logout')
  @UseGuards(JwtAuthGuard)
  public async logout(@Req() req: IRequestWithUser) {
    const { user } = req;
    await this.authService.removeRefreshToken(user);
    this.authService.clearCookie(req.res);
    return {
      logout: true,
    };
  }
  ```
